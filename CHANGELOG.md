## 0.23.1 - 2018-08-02
## Added
- Add ie-compat meta tag to the index by default. [#316](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/316)
- Add `external_script` and `external_css` keywords to dash `__init__`. [#305](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/305)

## 0.23.0 - 2018-08-01
## Added
- Dash components are now generated at build-time and then imported rather than generated when a module is imported. This should reduce the time it takes to import Dash component libraries, and makes Dash compatible with IDEs.

## 0.22.1 - 2018-08-01
## Fixed
- Raise a more informative error if a non JSON serializable value is returned from a callback [#273](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/273)

## 0.22.0 - 2018-07-25
## Added
- Assets files & index customization [#286](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/286)
- Raise an error if there is no layout present when the server is running [#294](https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/294)


## 0.21.1 - 2018-04-10
## Added
- `aria-*` and `data-*` attributes are now supported in all dash html components. (#40)
- These new keywords can be added using a dictionary expansion, e.g. `html.Div(id="my-div", **{"data-toggle": "toggled", "aria-toggled": "true"})`

## 0.21.0 - 2018-02-21
## Added
- #207 Dash now supports React components that use [Flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/).
    To support Flow, `component_loader` now has the following behavior to create docstrings
    as determined in discussion in [#187](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/187):
        1. If a Dash component has `PropTypes`-generated typing, the docstring uses the `PropTypes`, _regardless of whether the component also has Flow types (current behavior)._
        2. Otherwise if a Dash component has Flow types but _not `PropTypes`_, the docstring now uses the objects generated by `react-docgen` from the Flow types.

## 0.20.0 - 2018-01-19
## Added
- `exceptions.PreventUpdate` can be raised inside a callback to elegantly prevent
the callback from updating the app. See https://community.plot.ly/t/improving-handling-of-aborted-callbacks/7536/2 for context
and #190 for the PR.

## Changed
- Many pylint style fixes.
  See #163, #164, #165, #166, #167, #168, #169, #172, #173, #181, #185, #186, #193
- New integration test framework #184
- Submodules are now imported into the `dash` namespace for better IDE completion #174

# 0.19.0 - 2017-10-16
## Changed
- üîí  CSRF protection measures were removed as CSRF style attacks are not relevant
to Dash apps. Dash's API uses `POST` requests with content type
`application/json` which are not susceptible to unwanted requests from 3rd
party sites. See https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/141 for more.
- üîí  Setting `app.server.secret_key` is no longer required since CSRF protection was
removed. Setting `app.server.secret_key` was difficult to document and
a very common source of confusion, so it's great that users won't get bitten
by this anymore :tada:

# 0.18.3 - 2017-09-08
## Added
- `app.config` is now a `dict` instead of a class. You can set config variables with
  `app.config['suppress_callback_exceptions'] = True` now. The previous class-based
  syntax (e.g. `app.config.suppress_callback_exceptions`) has been maintained for
  backwards compatibility

## Fixed
- 0.18.2 introduced a bug that removed the ability for dash to serve the app on
  any route besides `/`. This has been fixed.
- 0.18.0 introduced a bug with the new config variables when used in a multi-app setting.
  These variables would be shared across apps. This issue has been fixed.
  Originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/flask-endpoint-error/5691/7
- The config setting `supress_callback_exceptions` has been renamed to
  `suppress_callback_exceptions`. Previously, `suppress` was spelled wrong.
  The original config variable is kept for backwards compatibility.

# 0.18.3rc1 - 2017-09-08
The prerelease for 0.18.3

# 0.18.2 - 2017-09-07
## Added
- üîß Added an `endpoint` to each of the URLs to allow for multiple routes (https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/70)

# 0.18.1 - 2017-09-07
## Fixed
- üêõ If `app.layout` was supplied a function, then it used to be called excessively. Now it is called just once on startup and just once on page load. https://github.com/plotly/dash/pull/128

# 0.18.0 - 2017-09-07
## Changed
- üîí  Removes the `/static/` folder and endpoint that is implicitly initialized by flask. This is too implicit for my comfort level: I worry that users will not be aware that their files in their `static` folder are accessible
- ‚ö°Ô∏è  Removes all API calls to the Plotly API (https://api.plot.ly/), the authentication endpoints and decorators, and the associated `filename`, `sharing` and `app_url` arguments. This was never documented or officially supported and authentication has been moved to the [`dash-auth` package](https://github.com/plotly/dash-auth)
- ‚úèÔ∏è Sorts the prop names in the exception messages (#107)

## Added
- üîß Add two new `config` variables: `routes_pathname_prefix` and `requests_pathname_prefix` to provide more flexibility for API routing when Dash apps are run behind proxy servers. `routes_pathname_prefix` is a prefix applied to the backend routes and `requests_pathname_prefix` prefixed in requests made by Dash's front-end. `dash-renderer==0.8.0rc3` uses these endpoints.
- üîß Added id to KeyError exception in components (#112)


## Fixed
- ‚úèÔ∏è  Fix a typo in an exception
- üîß Replaced all illegal characters in environment variable

##üîß Maintenance
- üìù  Update README.md
- ‚úÖ  Fix CircleCI tests. Note that the [`dash-renderer`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer) contains the bulk of the integration tests.
- üíÑ Flake8 fixes and tests (fixes #99 )
- ‚ú® Added this CHANGELOG.md

# 0.17.3 - 2017-06-22
‚ú® This is the initial open-source release of Dash
