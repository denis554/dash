# Contributing to dash

## Getting Started

Refer to the [readme](README.md) for installation and development instructions.

## Coding Style

Please lint any additions to react components with `pylint` and `flake8`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Use the [GitHub flow][] when proposing contributions to this repository (i.e. create a feature branch and submit a PR against the master branch).

## Running the Tests

**Warning:** _Tests do not currently run on windows. Track our progress: [#409](https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/409)._

To run the tests, you can use Python's `unittest` module, or a test runner like `nose2`.

To run all of the tests:
`python -m unittest tests`

Or:
`nose2 -v`

## Local configuration
You can configure the test server with the following variables:
### DASH_TEST_CHROMEPATH
If you run a special chrome set the path to your chrome binary with this environment variable.

### DASH_TEST_PROCESSES
If you encounter errors about Multi-server + Multi-processing when running under Python 3 try running the tests with the number of server processes set to 1.

### Example: single test run with configuration
```
DASH_TEST_CHROMEPATH=/bin/google-chrome-beta DASH_TEST_PROCESSES=1 python -m unittest -v test.test_integration.Tests.test_inputs
```

## Making a contribution

1. Create a pull request and tag the Plotly team (`@plotly/dash`) and tag / request review from [@rmarren1](https://github.com/rmarren1) and [@T4rk1n](https://github.com/T4rk1n).
2. After a review has been done and your changes have been approved, create a prerelease and comment in the PR. Version numbers should follow [semantic versioning][]. To create a prerelease:
    * Add `rc1` to `version.py` (`./dash/version.py`) e.g. `0.13.0rc1`
        - If needed, ask @chriddyp to get PyPi package publishing access.
    * Run `python setup.py sdist` to build a distribution zip.
    * Check the `dist` folder for a zip ending with your selected version number. Double check that this version number ends with `rc#`, as to not mistakenly publish the package.
    * Run `twine upload dist/<package_name>`.
3. Comment in the PR with the prerelease version
4. Update the top-level comment to include info about how to install, a summary of the changes, and a simple example.
    * This makes it easier for a community member to come in and try it out. As more folks review, it's harder to find the installation instructions deep in the PR
    * Keep this top-level comment updated with installation instructions (e.g. the `pip install` command)
5. Make a post in the [Dash Community Forum][]
    * Title it `":mega: Announcement! New <Your Feature> - Feedback Welcome"`
    * In the description, link to the PR and any relevant issue(s)
    * Pin the topic so that it appears at the top of the forum for two weeks
